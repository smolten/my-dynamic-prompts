0.1 Initial implementation
0.2 Fixed Batch img2img implementation
0.3 Added interval implementation for combinations, i.e. you can now use {1-2$$op1|opt2|opt3} which will choose one or two options. Thanks to @galvanized for this.
0.4 Rows in a wildcard file that contain dynamic syntax will be resolved. This enables recusive resolution. See [this](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompting/issues/3) feature request for a use case
0.4.1 Fixed regular expression for wildcards, it previously didn't allow wildcard files with underscores in them.
0.4.2 Ignoring unknown characters in non-utf8 encoding wildcard files
0.4.3 Printing prompts at logger level INFO
0.4.4 Fixed bug where num_batches was being interpreted as num_images
0.4.5 Enabled generation of grids
0.5.0 The script can now handle nested wildcard directories in order to make it easier to organise large wildcard collections. Comments and empty lines are now ignored. Both features thanks to @evanjs 
0.6.0 Added path globbing for wildcards. Thanks for @evanjs for the idea and original implementation
0.7.0 Updated wildcard ui by @TheAwesomeGoat.7.0 Updated wildcard ui by @TheAwesomeGoat
0.8.0 Combinatorial generation 
0.9.0 Started a modifer library. Turns out it's much better than the long unsorted lists of artists you find elsewhere.
0.9.1 Added local Random instance to ensure repeatability without changing the global random number generator
0.9.2 Added additional artists and refactored code.
0.10.0 Added magic prompts
0.11.0 Migrated to an extension
0.12.0 Added a slider to enable combinatorial generation in batches, in other words, run the same set of prompts with different seeds
0.13.0 Added same seed checkbox to keep the seed constant for all generations.
0.13.1 Fixed light mode css
0.13.2 Fixed combinatorial bug which generated duplicate templates
0.13.3 Added an option to revert 0.9.1. There isn't a ui for it yet, but you can edit constants.py. Change to UNLINK_SEED_FROM_PROMPT = True
0.13.4 Fixed 0.13.3, but thiss time for real
0.13.5 Updated stylesheet from @Yaiol to fix light and dark theme
0.13.6 Moved wildcards into the collections directory and added the parrot zone collection with thanks to @jmpaz 
0.13.7 Python 3.8 compatibility
0.13.8 Allow sampling with replacement for variants, i.e. {2$$X|Y} can return X,X Y,Y X,Y and Y,X. Useful in combination with wildcards. {2$$__artists__} now also chooses two options from the artists.txt file.
0.13.9 Added implicit lower and upper ranges to combinations - thanks to @galvanized
0.14.0 Added the ability to change the combinations joiner from the default "," to anything you like, e.g. {1$$and$$red|blue} gives you red and blue - contributed by @cobryan05 
0.15.0 Improvements to Magic Prompt by @SineSwiper - added a slider to adjust the prompt length and another to tune creativity.
0.15.1 Fixed an error caused when setting wildcard_dir in config.json, also other minor bug fixes
0.15.2 Handle situation where no prompts are generated.
0.16.0 Added a checkbox to enable writing all generated prompts to a text file.
0.17.0 Dynamic prompts is now an AlwaysVisible script. It now plays nicely with other scripts like X/Y plot. Big thanks to @stysmmaker
0.17.1 Minor bug fix checking type of combinatorial batches
0.18.0 Added Jinja2 templates as an experimental feature
0.19.0 Added a checkbox to enable unlinking seeds from prompts. This feature has been available for sometime but there hasn't been a checkbox in the ui to enable it.
0.19.1 Added missing install.py to install Jinja2
0.19.2 Fixed bug in MagicPrompt that broke prompts with pipes, https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts/issues/54
0.20.0 Added random, randint, and permutations jinja extensions
0.20.1 Using launch.run_pip instead of subprocess to install dependencies
0.21.0 Added a checkbox to disable dynamic prompts if needed
0.22.0 Added a weighted choice function to jinja2 templates
0.23.0 Added I'm feeling lucky for the ultimate in lazy prompting
0.23.1 Fixed a bug that didn't limit the number of prompts when using combinatorial generation and large wildcard files
0.24.0 I'm feeling lucky now using the prompt as a search string.
0.24.1 Re-wrote combinatorial generation to use a queue instead of recursion
0.24.2 Minor bug fix in weighted choice jinja2 extension
0.24.3 Added shuffle to combinatorial generation so that a different subset of prompts is generated every time if the total number of prompts is greater than Batch size * Batch count
0.24.4 Tucked help into separate accordions to prevent too much clutter
0.25.0 Negative prompts are now dynamic, Big thanks to @lilly1987
0.25.1 Explicitly setting encoding when writing prompts to file. Also ignoring errors
