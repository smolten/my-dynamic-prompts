Instead of generating random prompts from a template, combinatorial generation produces every possible prompt from the given string.
The prompt 'I {love|hate} {New York|Chicago} in {June|July|August}' will produce 12 variants in total.
Don't forget to increase the 'Batch count'/'Batch size' value accordingly.
	
The value of the 'Seed' field is only used for the first image. To change this, look for 'Fixed seed' in the 'Advanced options' section.`.trim(),

Re-run your combinatorial batch this many times with a different seed each time.
The maximum number of outputs = Combinatorial batches * Batch size * Batch count.
To specify the maximum number of prompt combinations use 'Batch count'/'Batch size' options.`.trim(),

Magic Prompt adds interesting modifiers to your prompt for a little bit of extra spice.
The first time you use it, the MagicPrompt model is downloaded so be patient.

Uses the lexica.art API to create random prompts.
The prompt in the main prompt box is used as a search string.
Leaving the prompt box blank returns a list of completely randomly chosen prompts.
Try it out, it can be quite fun.
